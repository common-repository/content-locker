    Social share is the <strong>new currency of 2017</strong>, and if you aren't grabbing a piece of this big piece of pie, you are staying behind.
</p>

<p>
   With the Content Locker plugin, you are basically trading your valuable content for social shares - whether in the shape of a Facebook Like, A Tweet, or a +1 on Google.
</p>

<p>
    You are giving your visitors a chance to read more content by giving a social vote to the URL you want.
</p>

<p>
    Content Locker acts as a payment wall, but instead of giving you money to read your content - your visitors are giving you a social vote which in turn helps your content go viral over the course of time. Just imagine turning every visitor into a follower or a fan. You can keep marketing to them in future, and with their "Likes" and Tweets, their friends will come to know of your website or content as well.
</p>

<p>
    It is a win-win situation really. Your visitors get access to your valuable content and you <strong>get more followers, likes and traffic</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    So, what exactly does the Content Locker do for you? Here are Just a few things it is capable of:
</p>


<h3>1. Gain More Social Traffic</h3>

<p>
    Your content is valuable, and if you do not want your visitors to read everything for free, you should ask for something in return. In the past, this used to be hard cash but over the years, asking for Likes and Shares has been easier and more valuable for webmasters.
</p>

<p>
    Content Locker hides parts of your content and only allows visitors who give you social votes to see the content. This social vote can be in the form of a Facebook Like, A Tweet, or even a Google +1.
</p>

<h3>2. Turn Your Visitors into Subscribers</h3>


<p>
    If you want your visitors to follow you or Like your page, you can do that with the Content Locker as well. You can even use the "Sign-in Locker" feature to gain the good 'ol subscribers by <strong>getting their email ID, Name</strong> and other info from their social media accounts. The plugin has an option to enable manual email ID and name insertion as well.
</p>

<p>
    The plugin supports integration with MailChimp and MailerLite, with an option to export all the subscribers into a CSV file.
</p>

<h3>3. Turn Your Content Viral</h3>

<p>
    It is not hard to imagine what your traffic will be like if every visitor you get shares your content with their 100+ friends on websites like Facebook or Twitter. One visit will quickly turn into 100 and 100 will turn into 10,000 visitors. You see how beneficial the Content Locker is?
</p>


<h3>4. Enjoy Better Search Engine Rankings</h3>

<p>
    It is a pretty known fact that search engines like Google rely on social signals like your Facebook Like count of your Retweets to ranking your post. More shares and Tweets means <strong>your website will rank better</strong> than, say, an alternate website with fewer Likes and tweets.
